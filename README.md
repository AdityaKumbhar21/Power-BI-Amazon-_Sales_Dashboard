And most of the business was of B2B.

Conclusion:

We can keep an offer in the from April-June as most of the sales came in that period. Also we can target B2B audience more and keep an Occasional Sale on Festival like Gudi Padwa in Maharashtra, Ugadi in Karnataka ,Telangana as people are more likely to buy new things on festival.
And also we can cut-out the expenses of the marketing through other channels as the total sale came from the Amazon itself.
